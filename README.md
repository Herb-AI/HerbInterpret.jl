# HerbInterpret.jl

This package provides functionality for evaluating (candidate) programs in the Herb Program Synthesis framework. `HerbInterpret.jl` can handle arbitrary Julia expressions, but also arbitrary other interpretors for which an evaluation function is given.

For general usage please see the `HerbExamples` and our test suite.
